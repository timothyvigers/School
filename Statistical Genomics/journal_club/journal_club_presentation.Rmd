## Introduction

- The goal of normalization is to separate the interesting biological variation from the variation that is a result of sample preparation, array production and processing, etc.
- Affymetrix proposes scaling the arrays so that each one has the same mean expression summary measure.
  - This does not work well when there are non-linear relationships between arrays.

## Alternatives

- Other approaches, such as non-linear smooth curves or transforming data to standardize the distribution of intensities across arrays, rely on picking a "baseline" array.
- Bolstad et al. compare three different approaches, all of which combine data from every single array rather than relying on a baseline.

## Cyclic loess

- Basically an extension of the M vs. A plots discussed in class, but applied to pairwise combinations of Affymetrix arrays.
- M is the difference in log expression values and A is the average (a Bland-Altman plot).

## Cyclic loess

1. Take two arrays $i$ and $j$, each with probes $k=1,...,p$. 
2. Create an MA plot for these two arrays, and fit a loess curve through these data: $$M_k=log_2(\frac{x_{ki}}{x_{kj}}), A_k=\frac{log_2(x_{ki}x_{kj})}{2}$$

3. Subtract the normalization curve fits $M_k'=M_k-\hat{M_k}$ and obtain adjusted probe intensities: $$x_{ki}'=2^{A_k+\frac{M_k'}{2}},x_{kj}'=2^{A_k-\frac{M_k'}{2}}$$

4. Take each of these adjustments (one for each pairwise comparison between arrays) and weight them equally across the set of arrays.
