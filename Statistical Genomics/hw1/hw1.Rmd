# Case Studies

## Case Study 3

The aim of case study 3 is to identify subgroups of patients using cluster analysis and then build a model to differentiate between the clusters. Samples are taken from 60 patients with B-cell lymphomas.

### Experimental Design 1

### Experimental Design 2

Samples from each patient are labeled with
