  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               {$\beta$}-Cell dysfunction and insulin resistance magnify the risk of kidney injury in type 2 diabetes. The relationship between these factors and intraglomerular hemodynamics and kidney oxygen availability in youth with type 2 diabetes remains incompletely explored.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               Fifty youth with type 2 diabetes (mean age {\textpm} SD 16 {\textpm} 2 years; diabetes duration 2.3 {\textpm} 1.8 years; 60\% female; median HbA1c 6.4\% [25th, 75th percentiles 5.9, 7.6\%]; BMI 36.4 {\textpm} 7.4 kg/m2; urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 10.3 [5.9, 58.0] mg/g) 21 control participants with obesity (OCs; age 16 {\textpm} 2 years; 29\% female; BMI 37.6 {\textpm} 7.4 kg/m2), and 20 control participants in the normal weight category (NWCs; age 17 {\textpm} 3 years; 70\% female; BMI 22.5 {\textpm} 3.6 kg/m2) underwent iohexol and p-aminohippurate clearance to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow, kidney MRI for oxygenation, hyperglycemic clamp for insulin secretion (acute C-peptide response to glucose [ACPRg]) and disposition index (DI; {\texttimes}103 mg/kg lean/min), and DXA for body composition.                                         RESULTS               Youth with type 2 diabetes exhibited lower DI (0.6 [0.0, 1.6] vs. 3.8 [2.4, 4.5] {\texttimes} 103 mg/kg lean/min; P \&lt; 0.0001) and ACPRg (0.6 [0.3, 1.4] vs. 5.3 [4.3, 6.9] nmol/L; P \&lt; 0.001) and higher UACR (10.3 [5.9, 58.0] vs. 5.3 [3.4, 14.3] mg/g; P = 0.003) and intraglomerular pressure (77.8 {\textpm} 11.5 vs. 64.8 {\textpm} 5.0 mmHg; P \&lt; 0.001) compared with OCs. Youth with type 2 diabetes and OCs had higher GFR and kidney oxygen availability (relative hyperoxia) than NWCs. DI was associated inversely with intraglomerular pressure and kidney hyperoxia.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Youth with type 2 diabetes demonstrated severe {$\beta$}-cell dysfunction that was associated with intraglomerular hypertension and kidney hyperoxia. Similar but attenuated findings were found in OCs.},

  abstract = {Background               Meeting glycemic recommendations is challenging for youth with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes technology, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and hybrid closed-loop (HCL) automated insulin delivery systems, significantly increase achievement of glycemic targets; however, many youth struggle to sustain use of early HCL systems. Nocturnal alarm fatigue contributes to disrupted sleep and device discontinuation.                                         Methods               We examined the frequency and causes of nocturnal (10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) alarms in pediatric patients (N = 76, median age 14.5 years [interquartile range 11.8--17.0 years, range 7--24 years]) starting on a first-generation HCL system in a prospective observational study. Device data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models to examine change across time at 3-month intervals for 12 months.                                         Results               At baseline (HCL system in nonautomated mode), participants averaged 3.3 {\textpm} 0.6 alarms per night. In the 2 weeks after starting HCL (automated) mode, alarm frequency significantly increased to 5.4 {\textpm} 0.5 times per night (P \&lt;0.001). Alarm frequency decreased through the remainder of the observational period; however, CGM sensor and HCL system use also declined. The types of alarms were evenly distributed among sensor maintenance, sensor threshold, pump, and HCL-specific alarms.                                         Conclusion               These data show that HCL system nocturnal alarms are frequent and may be barriers to sleep quality and device use. Further research is needed to assess the impact of diabetes technology on sleep and to determine method to improve sleep quality with technology use.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Aim               Type 1 diabetes (T1D) increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, and insufficient sleep is prevalent. Emerging evidence suggests a link between sleep and cardiometabolic health, but this has not been examined across the lifespan in individuals with T1D. We aimed to examine associations between sleep and cardiometabolic health in adolescents and adults with T1D in a secondary analysis of data from a 4-week double-blind, random-order, placebo-controlled crossover trial of bromocriptine quick release (BCQR) therapy with a 4-week washout in between conditions.                                         Materials and Methods               Forty-two adults (19-60\,years) and 42 adolescents (12-18\,years) with T1D {$>$}9\,months completed 1\,week of home monitoring with wrist-worn actigraphy to estimate sleep duration and continuous glucose monitoring, anthropometrics, arterial stiffness, magnetic resonance imaging (adolescents only), and fasting laboratory testing at each treatment phase.                                         Results                                Sixty-two per cent of adolescents and 74\% of adults obtained {$<$}7\,h of sleep per night at baseline. After adjustment for age, sex and diabetes duration, baseline sleep {$<$}7\,h per night was associated with a higher body mass index, a higher waist circumference, a higher systolic blood pressure, worse arterial stiffness and a lower estimated insulin sensitivity (all                 p                 \,{$<$}\,.05). When examined by age group, associations between sleep duration and cardiometabolic health outcomes remained significant, predominantly for adolescents. In adolescents only, wake time was significantly later (                 p                 \,=\,.027) and time in bed was significantly longer with BCQR versus placebo (                 p                 \,=\,.049).                                                        Conclusions               Objectively measured sleep {$<$}7\,h per night was prevalent in adolescents and adults with T1D and associated with poorer cardiometabolic health markers. Small changes in sleep were seen following BCQR treatment in adolescents only. Sleep may be an important and novel target for improving cardiometabolic health in individuals with T1D.},

Methods                                T1D self-management behaviour data were downloaded from adolescents' (                 N                 \,=\,79) devices and mean daily frequency of blood glucose readings and insulin boluses were calculated. Diabetes distress was measured (Problem Areas in Diabetes--Teen questionnaire [PAID-T]), A1C collected, and zBMI calculated from height and weight. Three multiple linear regressions were performed with blood glucose readings, insulin boluses, and A1C as the three dependent variables and covariates (age, T1D duration), zBMI, diabetes distress, and the diabetes distress x zBMI interaction as independent variables.

Conclusions               Using objective behavioural data is useful for identifying how adolescent diabetes distress and zBMI affect daily bolusing behaviour amongst adolescent insulin pump users. Although distinct interventions exist to improve T1D self-management or diabetes distress, none addresses them together while considering zBMI. Decreasing diabetes distress could be especially important for youth with high zBMI.},
