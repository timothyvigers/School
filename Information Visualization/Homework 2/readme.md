# Analyze multivariate data with Tableau (adopted from John Stasko’s CS4460 at Georgia Tech)

This assignment will familiarize you with the commercial information visualization system Tableau. https://www.tableau.com

The goals of the assignment are for you to learn the capabilities provided by the system, learn the visualization methods it provides, and assess its utility in analyzing information repositories. You will work with some provided data sets in the assignment. Think about the kinds of questions that an analyst would be asking about the data sets.

The assignment has four parts:

## Gain familiarity with the system
Get a (free) student license for Tableau Desktop and install the system. https://www.tableau.com/academic/students

Familiarize yourself with the visualization techniques and the user interface of Tableau. The Tableau webpage provides many useful resources that will help you learn the system.

## Examine one of the sample datasets
Select one of the 3 datasets:

Colleges.csv
Movies.csv
Whiskeys.xlsx

You are free to pick the one set that is most interesting to you. Briefly scan the text of the file and familiarize yourself with the variables. Generate and write down (you will need to turn them in) a few hypotheses to be considered or questions to be asked about the data elements. Put yourself into the shoes of someone interested in that data (e.g. a student deciding where to go to college) and think about all the different kinds of analysis tasks that a person might want to perform in working with data sets such as these.

As an example, referring back to the first assignemnt, someone working with a dataset about breakfast cereals might have tasks like:

Do the different companies producing cereals have different styles of cereal that they favor?
Does high fat mean high calories?
What cereals would you recommend to someone on a diet who still wants some good taste?
Does the nutritional value of cereals vary a lot? If so, how?
Don't just generate simple queries like "Which cereal has the most sugar?" that can trivially be found with a spreadsheet. Further, try not to make all of your questions be about correlations, which seems to be a common thing to do.

Don’t expect the datasets to be clean and perfect. There will be missing values and erroneous entries. Work with what you have at your disposal. 

## Load and examine your selected dataset into the Tableau
Load your chosen data set into Tableau, then consider your hypotheses, tasks, and questions. Also use the system to explore the data set and see if you can discover other interesting or unexpected findings in the data. Put yourself in the shoes of a data analyst and consider questions that such a person would confront.

 

## Write a report about your findings (5 points)
Your report should consist of three parts.

Part 1 (3 points) - List your three most interesting questions and provide answers to each, along with a link to a Tableau Data Story that shows the visualization you used to answer each question. Allow about half a page per question. Each question should be answered with a different visualization, so that makes three data stories with at least three different visualizations (you can create more than one visualization per question). Briefly explain your analysis process that lead you to that insight as part of the data story.

Part 2 (0.5 point)- List one unexpected finding, insight, or discovery made about the data while exploring the dataset with the tool. Explain how the system helped to facilitate the finding. This should take about a paragraph.

Part 3 (1.5 point)- Critique the Tableau system. What are the system's strengths and weaknesses? For what kinds of user tasks is the system particularly well suited? Focus more here on the visualization techniques as opposed to the particular user interface quirks, though you should feel free to comment on user interface aspects when they are particularly good or bad. Describe characteristics of the visualization techniques using the concepts and terminology you have learned in class.

Together, the second and third parts should be close to 2 pages.
