## 1. Fit the models 
 
```{r}
# Models
inv1_mod <- lm(FEV1~pack_years+current_smoker+emphysema+race+height+bmi+trt,data=inv1)
inv2_mod <- lm(delta_FEV1~pre_FEV1+pack_years+current_smoker+emphysema+race+height+bmi,data=inv2)

# Random intercept
inv3_ri_nlme <- lme(FEV1~pack_years+current_smoker+emphysema+race+height+bmi+trt,random = ~1|ID,data=inv3)
inv3_ri_lmer <- lmer(FEV1~pack_years+current_smoker+emphysema+race+height+bmi+trt+(1|ID),data=inv3)

# Random intercept and random slope
inv3_ris_nlme <- lme(FEV1~pack_years+current_smoker+emphysema+race+height+bmi+trt,random = ~1+trt|ID,data=inv3)
#inv3_ris_lmer <- lmer(FEV1~trt+pack_years+current_smoker+emphysema+race+height+bmi+(1+trt|ID),data=inv3)
```

### Check that nlme and lme4 match for random intercept model:

```{r}
summary(inv3_ri_nlme)$tTable
summary(inv3_ri_lmer)$coefficients
```

### Compare to SAS:

### Check random intercept and random slope model:

lme() fits a model, but lmer() throws an error:

Error: number of observations (=2000) <= number of random effects (=2000) for term (1 + trt | ID); the random-effects parameters and the residual variance (or scale parameter) are probably unidentifiable

The estimates from SAS match those from lme(), but have 0 DF and therefore no p values for several variables:

```{r}
summary(inv3_ris_nlme)$tTable
```

All of this suggests that the random slope model should not be used.

### All model results

Investigator 1 used a linear model to examine the effect of bronchodilator use, pack-years of smoking history, current smoking status, emphysema, race, height and BMI on FEV1. According to this model, emphysema is significantly associated with pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1 (p < 0.001).

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(inv1_mod)
```

Investigator 2 also used a linear regression, but modeled the change from pre to post bronchodilator FEV1, adjusting for baseline FEV1, pack-years of smoking history, current smoking status, emphysema, race, height and BMI. According to this model, emphysema is significantly associated with change in FEV1 (p = 0.03).

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(inv2_mod)
```

Investigator 3 first used a random intercept and random slope model on FEV1 adjusting for bronchodilator use, pack-years of smoking history, current smoking status, emphysema, race, height and BMI. According to this model, emphysema is significantly associated with change in FEV1 (p < 0.001).

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(inv3_ris_nlme)$tTable
```

Investigator 3 then used a random intercept model on FEV1 adjusting for bronchodilator use, pack-years of smoking history, current smoking status, emphysema, race, height and BMI. According to this model, emphysema is significantly associated with change in FEV1 (p < 0.001).

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(inv3_ri_nlme)$tTable
```

## 2. Investigator 2 vs. investigators 1 and 3
### a. 

The model fit by investigator 2 is really asking whether the change in FEV1 is associated with emphysema after adjusting for the base set of confounders, and also after adjusting for baseline FEV1. Investigators 1 and 3 are asking whether both pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1 are associated with emphysema after adjusting for the base set of confounders, including treatment with a bronchodilator.

###b. 

The goal of the analysis is to determine if pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1 are jointly associated with emphysema after adjusting for the base set of confounders. So, investigators 1 and 3 are answering the question correctly.

## 3. Investigator 3
###a. 

Investigator 3 should choose the random intercept only model, since the random slope model throws an error when using the lme4 package. The error says that the random effects are unidentifiable, and I think this essentially means that there aren't enough data points to support a random slope model. Also, the SAS output for the model including a random slope doesn't look right, and doesn't provide any p values with which to make inference. 

### b. 

First of all, you can't (or shouldn't) compare models when one of them doesn't converge. Also, $\chi^2_2$ wouldn't be the correct distribution under the null hypothesis.

##4. Best model

I think the random intercept model run by investigator 3 is the best, because it answers the scientific question while accounting for within subject correlation (and the model actually converged). Investigator 1's model answers the correct question, but does not consider the fact that measurements within each subject will be correlated, so the standard errors and p values are probably too small. Finally, investigator 2's model doesn't even answer the correct question. 

##5. Matrices

###a. 

$$
Z_i = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

###b. 

$$
G= \begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_0 & \sigma^2_{0s} \\
\sigma^2_{0s} & \sigma^2_s
\end{pmatrix}
$$

###c. 

$$
\text{Var}(Y_i)= \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_0 & \sigma^2_{0s} \\
\sigma^2_{0s} & \sigma^2_s
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_{\epsilon} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2_{\epsilon}
\end{pmatrix}=\\
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_0 & \sigma^2_{0s} \\
\sigma^2_0+\sigma^2_{0s} & \sigma^2_{0s}+\sigma^2_s
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_{\epsilon} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2_{\epsilon}
\end{pmatrix}=\\
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_0 & \sigma^2_0+\sigma^2_{0s} \\
\sigma^2_0+\sigma^2_{0s} & \sigma^2_0+2\sigma^2_{0s}+\sigma^2_s
\end{pmatrix}+
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_{\epsilon} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2_{\epsilon}
\end{pmatrix}=\\
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_0+\sigma^2_{\epsilon} & \sigma^2_0+\sigma^2_{0s} \\
\sigma^2_0+\sigma^2_{0s} & \sigma^2_0+2\sigma^2_{0s}+\sigma^2_s+\sigma^2_{\epsilon}
\end{pmatrix}
$$


This matrix has 4 different parameters that need to be estimated ($\sigma^2_0$,$\sigma^2_s$,$\sigma^2_{0s}$, and $\sigma^2_{\epsilon}$), but because there are only two timepoints, there isn't enough data to support a random intercept and slope model. There are only two repeated measurements, so from this data we can only estimate 3 covariance parameters.
