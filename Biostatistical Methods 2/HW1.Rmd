```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(car)
# Read in data
hyponat <- read.table("/Users/timvigers/Documents/School/UC Denver/Biostatistics/Biostatistical Methods 2/Homeworks/Homework 1/data.txt",sep = " ",header = T)
```

# 1. First consider transforming covariates and the outcome.
## a. Is categorization necessary for BMI?

```{r}
polymod <- lm(sodium ~ bmi + I(bmi^2) + I(bmi^3) + I(bmi^4),data = hyponat)
anova(polymod)
vif(polymod)
```

The quadratic BMI term is significant, and the VIF values for the polynomials are really large. This just shows that there is indeed a quadratic relationship and that the polynomial terms are collinear (as we were told in the question). When this is the case, it's correct to make the variable categorical.
