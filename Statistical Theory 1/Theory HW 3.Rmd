```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Sam's R code:
```{r}
lambda <- 2
hist(-lambda * (log(1-(runif(1000,0,1)))), main = "Simulated Data")

x <- seq(0,12,0.1)
plot(x,dexp(x,lambda),type = "l",main = "True Distribution",ylab = "Frequency")
```

It looks like the simulated data is a pretty good approximation of the true distribution.
