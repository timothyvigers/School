#1. Use linear regression to examine the relationship between IQ (iq) and lead exposure (expose).

##A. What is the unadjusted (crude) estimate for the association between IQ and lead exposure?

There is a significant difference in the average IQ for those who haven't been exposed versus those who have (p = 0.0084). On average, IQ is 7.77035 points (95% CI:  to  points) lower for those exposed compared to unexposed.
