## Intro to R information
Create a new R markdown file: File -> New File -> R Markdown

Note: basic math can be done in R as well. Example:

```{r basicmath}
(5 + 6) / (7 * 3)
```
If you need help with a function, type in help("function")

Learning objectives: 

Reviewing: plot and lines

## 1 (C+B 3.36)
Consider the pdf $f_X(x) = \frac{63}{4}(x^6-x^8), \ -1<x<1$. Graph $\frac{1}{\sigma}f(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})$ for each of the following on the same axis.

```{r 1}
##the sequences for where each equation applies
x1 <- seq(-1,5,1)
x2 <- seq(-1,1,0.05)
x3 <- seq(2, 4, 0.05)
x4 <- seq(1,5,0.05)

##the plots themselves for each sequence
plot(x1, 0*x1,type="p", col="blue",ylab="f(x)",ylim=c(0,2)) #ylim=c(0,0.1)
lines(x2,(63/4)*(x2^6-x2^8), col="red")
lines(x3,(63/4)*((x3-3)^6 - (x3-3)^8), col="green")
lines(x4,(63/8)*(((x4-3)/2)^6 - ((x4-3)/2)^8), col="purple")
```
